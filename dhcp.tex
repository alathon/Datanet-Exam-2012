\section{DHCP}
DHCP is used when a computer wants to connect to a network. It is used
to assign IP addresses to connecting computers.

The computer that wants to connect, sends a DHCP packet to address
0.0.0.0 and the broadcast address 255.255.255.255. The DHCP service
should then give a lease on an address to the connecting
machine. The machine sends a DHCP discover packet, the server answers
with a DHCP offer packet, the machine sends a DHCP request packet, and
finally the server sends a DHCP ACK.

\subsection{CIDR}
CIDR is used to calculate the IP address. The format is x.x.x.x/n
where n ranges from 1 to 32.

To convert from full decimal notation to CIDR notation, we convert the
decimal notation to binary, and note how many bits are set. This
defines what $n$ in the previous example should be.\\
For instance with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 would be
255.255.255.0/24 in CIDR notation, since 24 bits are set in the
decimal format.
