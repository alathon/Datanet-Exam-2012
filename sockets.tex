\section{Sockets}
Sockets sit in between a process and the underlying layers - Providing an easy
bridge between the application and transport layers. An internet socket, as is
the topic here, has a local IP:Port, a remote IP:Port, and a Protocol. The protocol
can be UDP, TCP, or one of the other transport-layer protocols.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A UDP socket is a connectionless socket, using UDP as the transport layer mechanism.
    \item A TCP socket is a connection-oriented socket that uses TCP or SCTP.
\end{itemize}

A socket pair is a pair of two communicating sockets (One on the local machine,
one on the remote machine), which together form a 4-tuple (Source IP, destination IP,
source port, destination port). TCP socket 4-tuples are assigned a socket number,
where-as each local unique UDP socket is assigned a socket number.

Raw sockets are also available, and are used in networking equipment for ICMP,
OSPF, IGMP and similar.
